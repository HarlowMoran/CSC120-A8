- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment actually went a lot better than I was expecting it to! The idea of inheritance makes a lot of sense, and I felt it was really easy to implement in this assignment!

I also noticed that I followed the README as closely as a possibly could, which is something I struggled with a bit in the first half of the semester. In general, I think this assignment went a lot better because of this.
